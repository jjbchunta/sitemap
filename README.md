# How to Implement
 Dropping Map Sourcecode into your website.

There are only two things you need to change about the page.

1.) Paste the <div> tag below into the desired page.

'''html
<div id="gmp-map"></div>
'''

I hear that you use Wordpress, so something that you can do if you don't want to inject HTML into the source page is download a plugin that allows you to write HTML to a shortcode, and you can just paste that shortcode into the desired location of the map.

Alternatively, if Elementor has a code snipit widget, just pasting this tag into that block.
